# Margin Leverage 
This is the repository for our margin leverage smart contract's internals.

### Project structure

### Running tests
To run tests with a shortcut, give the `test.sh` appropriate permissions:
```sh
chmod +x ./test.sh
```
Then, run all tests with backtrace(where it is supported by Foundry):
```sh
./test.sh
```
